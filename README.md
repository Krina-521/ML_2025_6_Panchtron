## 6. Modelling and Prediction of Athletic Readiness based on Sleep and Recovery Patterns

- **Problem Statement:** In collegiate basketball, the athletes get fatigued due to frequent
games, travel, regular training, and academic and social commitments. Fatigue leads to a
disrupted sleep schedule and slow recovery. The objective of this project is to assess the
impact of athlete sleep patterns on their performance (readiness) and thereby predict
RSImod (readiness measure).

- **Milestones / Deliverables:**
  - Fill in the missing values in the dataset using data appropriate technique.
  - Analyze the relationship between sleep and recovery features and RSImod.
  - Train a model to predict the RSImod based on the sleep and recovery features.
  - Explain your model outcomes using xAI techniques.
  - Report your findings, whether generic or cluster-based.
 
- **Dataset:** Athlete Dataset
